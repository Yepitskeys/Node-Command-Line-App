# Node-Command-Line-App

Project Description: The goal of this project was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

    * When a user uses the generator, they are presented with a command-line application that accepts user input.
    * When the user initiates the app, they are prompted for information about their application repository
    * When the user inputs their data, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of their project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
